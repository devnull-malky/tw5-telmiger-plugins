//rpn// is a lightweight Javascript macro for basic math operations. It is inspired by formerly popular calculators using Reverse Polish Notation (see [[Wikipedia|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation]] for more info). Usage example:

`<<rpn 5000 200 * 2 p en-GB>>` output: <<rpn 5000 200 * 2 p en-GB>>
