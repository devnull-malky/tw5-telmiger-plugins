!! Simple Search 

This plugin provides a nice and simple interface for searching your wiki. It is designed for mobile and desktop screens. 
''Reduce to the max.'' The standard search input field in the sidebar is gone, instead there is a {{$:/plugins/telmiger/simple-search/ui/Buttons/search}} [[button|$:/plugins/telmiger/simple-search/ui/Buttons/search]].


!!! Keyboard accessible

* Press <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Space</kbd> to ''launch and close'' Simple Search (new //global keyboard shortcut// for TW 5.1.18+). 
* Jump to search results with <kbd>Tab</kbd>. Then, depending on your browser and settings, select a list item using <kbd>Tab</kbd> or arrow keys <kbd>up</kbd> and <kbd>down</kbd>.
* Confirm with <kbd>Enter</kbd>.


!!! Search in fields
Primary results are listed for tiddlers containing the search term in the ''title'' OR the ''caption'' fields. 

The secondary list finds results based on all other fields (not title nor caption). This can be adapted via settings.


!!! Create tiddlers

Empty result list? No problem. Create missing tiddlers using the search term as title and caption. 

* Hit <kbd>Tab</kbd> until you reach the plus button (+).
* Create a tiddler with <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

See template options on the ''settings tab''. â€“ Hat tip to //Diego Mesa// for inspiring this feature.


!!! Settings

Make sure to visit the ''settings tab'' to adjust your preferences.


!! Core overruling

This plugin overwrites $:/core/ui/SideBarSegments/search and nothing else.
